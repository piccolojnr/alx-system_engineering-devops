**Postmortem: Ubuntu 14.04 Container Party Gone Wrong**

🥳 **Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:**
  - Start Time: March 8, 2024, 3:00 PM (UTC)
  - End Time: March 8, 2024, 4:30 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - Our website hosted on an Ubuntu 14.04 container had a little too much fun and decided to take a nap. Users got a surprise timeout from the party with a blank screen – not the RSVP we were hoping for.

🎉 **Timeline:**
- **Detection:**
  - March 8, 2024, 3:00 PM (UTC): Users started sending SOS signals about the website being MIA.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Checked Apache logs for clues – felt like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces.
  - Tested network connections, hoping it wasn't a classic "unplugged cable" situation. Spoiler: It wasn't that simple.
  - Called in the tech heroes (DevOps) after 20 minutes of juggling without success.

🚀 **Resolution:**
  - Found out a sneaky security update missed the invitation, leaving our website vulnerable to uninvited guests. Applied the update and kindly asked the gatecrasher to leave.
  - Gave the Apache service a virtual wake-up call, and voila – our website was back in action at 4:15 PM (UTC).
  - Kept an eye on the container for the next 15 minutes, hoping it wouldn't decide to pull another disappearing act.

🕵️‍♂️ **Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - The container party got crashed because of a missing security update, making Apache throw a little tantrum. The update no-show led to the website ghosting us.
  - The lack of the update made the website grumpy and unresponsive.

- **Resolution:**
  - Had a serious chat with the container about the importance of staying updated.
  - Applied the missing security update, promising the container an extra slice of virtual cake for good behavior.
  - Decided it was time to retire our Ubuntu 14.04 container and plan a move to a newer, cooler Ubuntu version.

🎭 **Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Set up a regular schedule for security updates, ensuring our container party stays crash-free.
  - Made a checklist for post-update checks, preventing any more unexpected surprises.
  - Started planning the big container move to a newer Ubuntu version – time to upgrade the party vibes.

🎉 **Tasks:**
  - **Short-Term:**
    - Checked all containers for missing security updates – safety first!
    - Shared our incident resolution steps with the team – spreading the wisdom.
    - Updated the monitoring system to shout louder about critical updates – no more gatecrashers allowed.

  - **Mid-Term:**
    - Scheduled a review of our container update process – no more missing the party.
    - Checked out automation tools for smoother security updates – less stress, more fun.
    - Started planning the container move – with confetti cannons included.

  - **Long-Term:**
    - Set a policy for regular container check-ups – no more container neglect.
    - Explored automated testing for post-update checks – because safety nets are cool.
    - Set a timeline for the big container move – upgrading the party to the next level.
