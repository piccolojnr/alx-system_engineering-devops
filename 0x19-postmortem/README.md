**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: March 8, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)
  - End Time: March 8, 2024, 2:45 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - The outage affected the core authentication service, resulting in a 30% user base unable to log in. Users experienced delays in accessing their accounts, impacting overall user experience.

**Timeline:**
- **Detection:**
  - March 8, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC): The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in authentication failures.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Initial investigations focused on database health, assuming a potential bottleneck in user data retrieval.
  - Misleadingly pursued a network latency hypothesis, leading to unnecessary checks and delays.
  - The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Backend Engineering teams after 30 minutes of inconclusive investigation.
- **Resolution:**
  - Identified a database query optimization flaw causing delays in user authentication checks.
  - Implemented an emergency fix by optimizing the query and deployed it to production at 1:45 PM (UTC).
  - Monitored the system for an additional hour to ensure stability.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - The root cause was traced to an inefficient database query used for user authentication, causing a cascading effect on system response times.
  - Specifically, a missing index in the user table resulted in suboptimal query performance, leading to delays in the authentication process.

- **Resolution:**
  - The immediate fix involved adding the missing index to the user table, significantly improving the efficiency of the authentication query.
  - A thorough code review was initiated to identify any similar performance bottlenecks in other parts of the application.
  - The database schema and query optimization process were revisited to prevent similar issues in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of all database queries to identify and address potential performance bottlenecks.
  - Implement regular audits of database indexes to ensure they align with evolving application requirements.
  - Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more granular insights into specific service components, minimizing detection time.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Short-Term:**
    - Patch the production database with the missing index.
    - Conduct a post-incident review with the engineering team to share insights and lessons learned.
    - Update monitoring alerts to include specific metrics related to authentication response times.

  - **Mid-Term:**
    - Schedule a database performance audit to proactively identify and address potential bottlenecks.
    - Implement a regular cadence for code reviews with a focus on query optimization.
    - Enhance collaboration between DevOps and Backend Engineering teams for faster incident response.

  - **Long-Term:**
    - Explore automated tools for continuous database optimization and query analysis.
    - Establish a knowledge-sharing platform to disseminate incident learnings across the engineering organization.
    - Conduct periodic training sessions on effective debugging and incident response strategies.
